## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our Code of Conduct.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Use the issue templates as a guide to how to identify bugs or add features.
- Review other open issues before opening a new issue as to avoid any repetition
- Issues added will be addressed in due time but will take time to be reviewed and resolved.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the repository, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests to our repository are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement resolved even faster. In general, Pull Requests should:

- Fix/Add the Issue/Feature in question. 
- Make sure it does not affect the current repository in a negative way (A review will take place).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible. (Messy code can be overlooked)
- Make the Pull Request when happy with your contribution.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major addition), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.
